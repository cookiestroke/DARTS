# DARTS

**Learning about The Key Approaches used In Prior Work for Neural Architecture Search and Implementing DARTS**

We observe the effect of the network size on the DARTS architecture. The code used to generate the DARTS architecture is given [here](https://github.com/dragen1860/DARTS-PyTorch).

First we train 4 different seed value at 100 epochs and select the seed value which has the highest testing accuracy.
